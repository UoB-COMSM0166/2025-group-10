## Lecture Notes

### Week 1: Game Selection Phase 1
This week, our focus was on coming up with ideas for our game project. After a lot of brainstorming and discussions, we finalized three potential game concepts. Each idea comes with a unique twist and its own set of challenges. We considered different gameplay mechanics, potential difficulties in implementation, and how to make each game engaging for players. It was a fun but challenging process, and now we are excited to move forward with refining and selecting the best concept to develop.

| Game                      | Description                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kids Going Down the Stairs| **Twist**: Add different types of stairs (moving, disappearing, or bouncy).<br>**Challenges**: Implement dynamic stair generation and smooth character physics. |
| Frogger-like Road Crossing| **Twist**: Add weather effects like rain and additional road obstacles.<br>**Challenges**: Design random vehicle generation and collision detection for interactions. |
| Jumping Over Pits on a Bridge | **Twist**: The bridge collapses over time, and pits have hazards like wind or slowing obstacles.<br>**Challenges**: Build responsive jumping mechanics and random pit placement on a dynamic bridge. |

### Week 2: P5.js & Agile Techniques
This week, we designed a simple yet fun drawing game that allows players to use the mouse to draw colorful circles on the canvas. The gameplay is very intuitiveâ€”players simply click to draw circles and can adjust the brush color by pressing different keys.

During the development process, we created a Kanban Board to manage project progress. We divided the work into different tasks, and by using the Kanban Board, we were able to clearly track the status of each task and ensure effective collaboration among team members.

### Week 3: Game Demo Videos

#### 1. Kids Going Down the Stairs

Video link: https://youtu.be/rdkpm2Llshk?si=53pmZ8UEkNTFCre_

This game is all about quick reflexes and fast-paced action. The screen continuously scrolls downward, and players must guide their character down the stairs to avoid getting caught by the spikes at the top. If hit by the spikes, they lose health, and missing a step results in instant failure.

Different types of stairs have unique effects, adding variety and challenge. Some platforms might disappear, move, or even bounce the player unpredictably. The game is intense, highly reactive, and keeps players on edge with its rapid pace and unpredictable obstacles, making for an exciting and adrenaline-pumping experience.

#### 2. Frogger-like Road Crossing

Video link: https://youtu.be/M9n7DXvjcw8?si=FcxUdEGWT1FpQf-O

In Frog Cross Road, players must guide a small frog safely across a series of busy roads, rivers, and other hazardous environments. The screen continuously moves forward, pressuring players to make quick decisions to avoid getting left behind or hit by passing vehicles.

The game features various obstacles, such as cars, trucks, floating logs, and fast-moving rapids, each requiring precise timing to navigate. Some platforms move unpredictably, adding to the challenge. With its fast-paced gameplay, high tension, and increasing difficulty, Frog Cross Road is an exciting test of reflexes and strategy. The ever-changing environment and quick reaction requirements keep players engaged and on edge throughout the experience.

### Week 4: Object Oriented Design

#### Stakeholder List
- Internal: Owner, Developer, Marketing Team, Project Managers
- External: Customers, Potential Customers, Public, App Stores, Competitors

#### Epics
1. Improve player engagement through challenging mechanics 
2. Enhance happiness for player

#### User Stories
