## Lecture Notes

### Week 1: Game Selection Phase 1
This week, our focus was on coming up with ideas for our game project. After a lot of brainstorming and discussions, we finalized three potential game concepts. Each idea comes with a unique twist and its own set of challenges. We considered different gameplay mechanics, potential difficulties in implementation, and how to make each game engaging for players. It was a fun but challenging process, and now we are excited to move forward with refining and selecting the best concept to develop.

| Game                      | Description                                                                                               |

### Week 2: P5.js & Agile Techniques
This week, we designed a simple yet fun drawing game that allows players to use the mouse to draw colorful circles on the canvas. The gameplay is very intuitiveâ€”players simply click to draw circles and can adjust the brush color by pressing different keys.

During the development process, we created a Kanban Board to manage project progress. We divided the work into different tasks, and by using the Kanban Board, we were able to clearly track the status of each task and ensure effective collaboration among team members.

### Week 3: Game Demo Videos

#### 1. Angel Drop

Video link: https://youtu.be/rdkpm2Llshk?si=53pmZ8UEkNTFCre_

This game is all about quick reflexes and fast-paced action. The screen continuously scrolls downward, and players must guide their character down the stairs to avoid getting caught by the spikes at the top. If hit by the spikes, they lose health, and missing a step results in instant failure.

Different types of stairs have unique effects, adding variety and challenge. Some platforms might disappear, move, or even bounce the player unpredictably. The game is intense, highly reactive, and keeps players on edge with its rapid pace and unpredictable obstacles, making for an exciting and adrenaline-pumping experience.

#### 2. Frogger-like Road Crossing

Video link: https://youtu.be/M9n7DXvjcw8?si=FcxUdEGWT1FpQf-O

In Frog Cross Road, players must guide a small frog safely across a series of busy roads, rivers, and other hazardous environments. The screen continuously moves forward, pressuring players to make quick decisions to avoid getting left behind or hit by passing vehicles.

The game features various obstacles, such as cars, trucks, floating logs, and fast-moving rapids, each requiring precise timing to navigate. Some platforms move unpredictably, adding to the challenge. With its fast-paced gameplay, high tension, and increasing difficulty, Frog Cross Road is an exciting test of reflexes and strategy. The ever-changing environment and quick reaction requirements keep players engaged and on edge throughout the experience.

#### 3. Up Up Angel (Final decision)

Video link: https://youtube.com/shorts/dFYu5HwDuT4?si=URENKYaQuJJZ4qi2

"Up Up Angel" is a platformer game inspired by Doodle Jump, but with our own unique twist. Instead of an automatically bouncing character, players must manually jump using controls, adding a layer of strategy and challenge.

Our goal was to reimagine the classic jumping game with a celestial theme. In this version, players control an angel ascending toward the heavens, navigating through clouds while avoiding small creatures that block their path. We designed the game with elements representing heaven, such as floating platforms made of clouds and a pair of golden wings at the highest point, symbolizing the angel's final transformation.

By adding manual jumping mechanics, we made the game feel more interactive and engaging. Players must carefully time their jumps and plan their movements to reach their goal successfully. This project allowed us to experiment with game mechanics and level design, and we aimed to create a fun yet challenging experience with a distinctive angelic theme.

### Week 4: Object Oriented Design

#### Stakeholder List
- Internal: Owner, Developer, Marketing Team, Project Managers
- External: Customers, Potential Customers, Public, App Stores, Competitors

#### Epics
1. Improve player engagement through challenging mechanics 
2. Enhance happiness for player

#### User Stories
- As a busy working professional, I want simple but meaningful achievements, so that I can feel joy even with minimal effort.
- As a streamer, I want a game that is both challenging and entertaining, so that my audience stays engaged while watching my gameplay.
- As a student, I want a leaderboard system, so that I can compete with my classmates and see who gets the highest score.

#### Brief
During this requirements workshop, our team deeply explored Epics, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria and applied these concepts to the requirements planning for our game, "Up Up Angel".

First, we learned that Epics are high-level requirements that group related user stories. For example, "making the game challenging" is one of our Epics, which includes mechanics like character movement, jumping, and dodging. This structure helps us organize requirements and keep the development direction clear.

Next, User Stories allow us to think from the player's perspective when defining game features. For instance, "As a player, I want a leaderboard system so that I can compete with my friends." This approach helps us focus on the user experience and ensures the game meets the needs of different types of players, such as streamers, working professionals, and students.

Finally, Acceptance Criteria define when a requirement is considered "done." For example, "Given that a player finishes a game session, when the score is calculated, then the leaderboard should update and display the player's rank." This clear criterion makes it easier for the development team to test and validate features.

Through this workshop, we not only gained a solid understanding of requirements analysis but also learned how to apply these concepts in the development process, ensuring that our game design is well-structured and aligned with player expectations.

## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?
  
Our game, Up Up Angel, is inspired by the classic mobile game Doodle Jump, but we adapted it for desktop platforms by changing the auto-jumping mechanic into manual jumping. This gives players more control and creates a deeper sense of focus and challenge.

To give the game a unique atmosphere, we introduced the theme of heaven and hell. The player controls a small angel who jumps upward through floating clouds, avoiding ghosts and hellfire while collecting candies that restore health. These elements represent both the obstacles and moments of support we encounter in life.At the top of the game, the angel can collect a glowing halo, symbolizing their final transformation into a true angel. This moment not only marks the playerâ€™s success but also represents a deeper message: with persistence and effort, people can reach their goals and ideals.

Our goal was to design a game that feels positive and healing, yet still challenging. By combining symbolic visuals with simple but engaging mechanics, Up Up Angel offers players an experience that is both uplifting and meaningful.
  
### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

### Design
Based on our initial user stories and the use case diagram, we collaboratively designed the system architecture of our game by creating a detailed class diagram and sequence diagram. This process was essential to ensuring a solid understanding of the structure and flow of the game before moving into implementation. By working as a team and discussing every design decision, we were able to align our expectations and divide responsibilities more effectively.

#### Class Diagram
The class diagram represents a high-level overview of our object-oriented design and depicts the core classes used in the game, their attributes, methods, and relationships. At the center of our game logic is the Sketch class, which is responsible for controlling the flow of the game. It manages setup, draw cycles, user interactions, and oversees the initialization of other key classes.
One of the most important classes is the Player class, which encapsulates all player-related behaviors such as jumping, moving left or right, checking collisions, and handling life count. It interacts with a number of other classes throughout the game loop.
Clouds are also a critical component in the game, serving as platforms for the player to land on and move between. We implemented two types of clouds â€” static ones and moving onesâ€” both inheriting from a common Cloud class. The MovingCloud class introduces horizontal motion logic and carries with it any object placed on top, ensuring consistent interaction.
Another important hierarchy in our game is the Objects class, which serves as a superclass for all interactable items within the game world. Subclasses include Monster, Danger, Halo, and Candy. Each of these subclasses defines its own behavior upon collision with the player. For instance, Danger and Monster can reduce the player's life if touched, whereas Candy can restore life. If player interacts with Halo, while player still has enough life, user will win the game.
All Objects instances are randomly generated on top of clouds. The game difficulty level determines the proportion and frequency of different objects (e.g., higher difficulty increases the number of moving clouds and dangerous objects). This structure makes the game dynamic and easily extensible.
The LifeHeart class is a utility class that visually represents the playerâ€™s remaining lives on the heads-up display. It is updated in real time as the player interacts with various objects.  

***Class Diagram***  
![Class Diagram](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-10/blob/main/docs/assets/readme/Updated%20Class%20Diagram.png)  

#### Sequence Diagram
After finalizing the class structure, we developed a sequence diagram to visualize the temporal interactions between these classes during game execution. This diagram begins with the display of the gameâ€™s starting interface, followed by the difficulty selection screen. Once a difficulty is selected, the Sketch class initializes instances of Player, Cloud, and Object classes according to the difficulty level settings.  
During the game loop, Player listens for user inputs to jump or move. As the player moves, the system checks for collisions with clouds and objects. If a collision occurs, the Player class calls the respective Object subclass method to handle the event (e.g., reducing life when hitting a Monster, or increasing score when collecting a Candy).
Meanwhile, the Sketch class continuously redraws the game scene using p5.jsâ€™s draw() function, updating the positions of all game elements. The LifeHeart class is called every frame to update the life display based on the playerâ€™s current state.  
Whenever the player reaches new heights, the shiftScreen() method in Sketch ensures that the player remains centered vertically by moving all clouds and objects downward, simulating an upward motion. This method also handles the recycling or removal of off-screen elements.  
***Sequence Diagram***  
![Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-10/blob/main/docs/assets/readme/Updated%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)  

#### Design Iteration and Agile Process
As we followed an agile development approach, our class and sequence diagrams were not static. Instead, we continuously revised and improved them as the game evolved. Early versions of the diagrams served as rough guides and allowed us to identify design issues early. As we added new features or refined gameplay mechanics, we updated the diagrams to reflect the current structure and ensure everyone on the team had a shared understanding of the system.  
The diagrams proved especially helpful when debugging or integrating features developed by different team members. They served not only as documentation but also as a communication tool within the team, allowing for clearer discussion on logic, flow, and potential improvements.  
Overall, our collaborative design approach â€” grounded in object-oriented principles and supported by UML diagrams â€” greatly contributed to the clarity, flexibility, and maintainability of our codebase.

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice)
 
Evaluation Report

1. Think Aloud Evaluation


Method

We conducted a Think Aloud session to observe players' real-time thoughts and actions. A facilitator explained the task, and participants were encouraged to verbalize their thoughts while playing. Two observers recorded player behaviors and comments.



Observations

Participants made the following comments during the playtest:

ï¼‘ï¼ŽThe ball bounces too fast.

ï¼’ï¼ŽI hope the interface can be more refined.

ï¼“ï¼ŽThe stationary platforms could be longer.

Note: We decided not to focus on the fourth comment about moving platforms.



Insights

Players hesitated and made trial-and-error movements at the start, indicating insufficient feedback and unclear physical mechanics. The fast bounce and rough interface design disrupted the immersion, while short platforms increased difficulty unnecessarily.


2. Heuristic Evaluation
   

Method

We invited a member from another team to act as an evaluator. They were asked to play the game independently and record usability issues based on Nielsenâ€™s 10 heuristic principles. No instructions or help were provided during the session.



Observations

The evaluator identified the following issues:

ï¼‘ï¼ŽThe character movement in our game isnâ€™t smooth enough. We hadnâ€™t noticed many of these issues before.

ï¼’ï¼ŽWithout guidance, players are unable to play the game.



Insights

These findings suggest violations of multiple usability heuristics, including "visibility of system status," "help and documentation," and "consistency and standards." The lack of clear instructions and feedback led to confusion during gameplay.



Summary and Action Plan

Our playtesters helped us notice many issues we had previously overlooked.

They revealed that the character movement in our game isnâ€™t smooth enough, which aligns with the results from our think-aloud sessions.

Without guidance, we observed that players had many questions and struggled to understand the game without instructions.

This shows that our gameâ€™s guidance and object functionalities are not clear enough.



Moving forward, we will:

Add an instruction page at the beginning of the game

Use icons to indicate character abilities and object functions

Refine visual design and level layout to improve clarity and usability

These improvements aim to reduce the learning curve and enhance the overall player experience.

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)
